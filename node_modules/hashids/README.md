Full Documentation
-------

A small Node.js class to generate YouTube-like hashes from one or many numbers. Use hashids when you do not want to expose your database ids to the user. Read full documentation at: [http://www.hashids.org/node-js/](http://www.hashids.org/node-js/)

Installation
-------

1. Node it up: [http://nodejs.org/download/](http://nodejs.org/download/)
2. Install using npm:
	
	`npm install -g hashids`
	

Production Note
-------

**BE CAREFUL WHICH VERSION OF HASHIDS YOU ARE USING.**

Since future improvements to Hashids might alter produced hashes, it's a good idea to specify *exact* Hashids version in your **package.json**, if their consistency is important to you (if you are storing them in database):

```javascript
	
	"dependencies": {
		"hashids": "0.3.3"
	}
```

Usage
-------

#### Encrypting one number

You can pass a unique salt value so your hashes differ from everyone else's. I use "this is my salt" as an example.

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var hash = hashids.encrypt(12345);
```

`hash` is now going to be:
	
	NkK9

#### Decrypting

Notice during decryption, same salt value is used:

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var numbers = hashids.decrypt("NkK9");
```

`numbers` is now going to be:
	
	[ 12345 ]

#### Decrypting with different salt

Decryption will not work if salt is changed:

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my pepper");

var numbers = hashids.decrypt("NkK9");
```

`numbers` is now going to be:
	
	[]
	
#### Encrypting several numbers

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var hash = hashids.encrypt(683, 94108, 123, 5);
```

`hash` is now going to be:
	
	aBMswoO2UB3Sj
	
You can also pass an array:

```javascript

var arr = [683, 94108, 123, 5];
var hash = hashids.encrypt(arr);
```

#### Decrypting is done the same way

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var numbers = hashids.decrypt("aBMswoO2UB3Sj");
```

`numbers` is now going to be:
	
	[ 683, 94108, 123, 5 ]
	
#### Encrypting and specifying minimum hash length

Here we encrypt integer 1, and set the **minimum** hash length to **8** (by default it's **0** -- meaning hashes will be the shortest possible length).

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt", 8);

var hash = hashids.encrypt(1);
```

`hash` is now going to be:
	
	gB0NV05e
	
#### Decrypting

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt", 8);

var numbers = hashids.decrypt("gB0NV05e");
```

`numbers` is now going to be:
	
	[ 1 ]
	
#### Specifying custom hash alphabet

Here we set the alphabet to consist of valid hex characters: "0123456789abcdef"

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt", 0, "0123456789abcdef");

var hash = hashids.encrypt(1234567);
```

`hash` is now going to be:
	
	b332db5
	
MongoDB Support
-------

MongoDB uses hex strings for their ObjectIds. You can convert them to Hashids like this:

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var hash = hashids.encryptHex("507f191e810c19729de860ea");
var objectId = hashids.decryptHex(hash);
```

`hash` will be:
	
	yNyaoWeKWVINWqvaM9bw
	
`objectId` will be as expected:
	
	507f191e810c19729de860ea
	
The length of the hex string does not matter -- it does not have to be a MongoDB ObjectId.
	
Randomness
-------

The primary purpose of hashids is to obfuscate ids. It's not meant or tested to be used for security purposes or compression.
Having said that, this algorithm does try to make these hashes unguessable and unpredictable:

#### Repeating numbers

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var hash = hashids.encrypt(5, 5, 5, 5);
```

You don't see any repeating patterns that might show there's 4 identical numbers in the hash:

	1Wc8cwcE

Same with incremented numbers:

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var hash = hashids.encrypt(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
```

`hash` will be :
	
	kRHnurhptKcjIDTWC3sx
	
#### Incrementing number hashes:

```javascript

var Hashids = require("hashids"),
	hashids = new Hashids("this is my salt");

var hash1 = hashids.encrypt(1), /* NV */
	hash2 = hashids.encrypt(2), /* 6m */
	hash3 = hashids.encrypt(3), /* yD */
	hash4 = hashids.encrypt(4), /* 2l */
	hash5 = hashids.encrypt(5); /* rD */
```

Curses! #$%@
-------

This code was written with the intent of placing created hashes in visible places - like the URL. Which makes it unfortunate if generated hashes accidentally formed a bad word.

Therefore, the algorithm tries to avoid generating most common English curse words. This is done by never placing the following letters next to each other:
	
	c, C, s, S, f, F, h, H, u, U, i, I, t, T

Running tests
-------
Hashids uses [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) spec tests, particularly [jasmine-node](https://npmjs.org/package/jasmine-node).
To install `sudo npm install -g jasmine-node`
then just run `jasmine-node .` in the root folder.
